# Instagrid
An image splitter and grid maker for the new instagram layout

# TODO
[]Show in the left column the cut down image to the right format
[x]Check the dimension so that it works best for instagram (1010, 1015...) maybe put in global settings
[]Add visible image separation on the images in the grid
[]Publish

Test / Check for vulnerabilities

# Improvements
[]Add image crop settings where you can move the zone that's gonna be selected and cut, link it to the menu on the left
