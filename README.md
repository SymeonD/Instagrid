# Instagrid
An image splitter and grid maker for the new instagram layout

# TODO
- [x] Show in the left column the cut down image to the right format
- [x] Check the dimension so that it works best for instagram (1010, 1015...) maybe put in global settings
- [ ] Add visible image separation on the images in the grid
- [ ] Publish
- [x] When grid image is selected and del or backspace pressed, remove it
- [x] if grid is clicked outside an image, reset the selected element
- [ ] Remove or implement edit buttons
- [ ] Check for image format

Test / Check for vulnerabilities

# Improvements
- [ ] Add image crop settings where you can move the zone that's gonna be selected and cut, link it to the menu on the left
- [ ] Enable selection of output image type
